    Class to represent a state on grid-based pathfinding problems. The class contains two static variables:
    map_width and map_height containing the width and height of the map. Although these variables are properties
    of the map and not of the state, they are used to compute the hash value of the state, which is used
    in the CLOSED list. 

    Each state has the values of x, y, g, h, and cost. The cost is used as the criterion for sorting the nodes
    in the OPEN list for both Dijkstra's algorithm and A*. For Dijkstra the cost should be the g-value, while
    for A* the cost should be the f-value of the node.
